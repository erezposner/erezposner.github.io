Nevertheless, failure by the endoscopist to identify such lesions increases the likelihood of lesion progression to subsequent colorectal cancer. Ultimately, colonoscopy remains operator-dependent, and the wide range of quality in colonoscopy examinations among endoscopists is influenced by variations in their technique, training, and diligence. This paper presents a novel real-time navigation guidance system for Optical Colonoscopy (OC). Our proposed system employs a real-time approach that displays both an unfolded representation of the colon and a local indicator directing to un-inspected areas. These visualizations are presented to the physician during the procedure, providing actionable and comprehensible guidance to un-surveyed areas in real-time, while seamlessly integrating into the physician&#8217;s workflow. Through coverage experimental evaluation, we demonstrated that our system resulted in a higher polyp recall (PR) and high inter-rater reliability with physicians for coverage prediction. These results suggest that our real-time navigation guidance system has the potential to improve the quality and effectiveness of Optical Colonoscopy and ultimately benefit patient outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/2306.04269#:~:text=This%20paper%20presents%20a%20novel,directing%20to%20un%2Dinspected%20areas.\">The Full paper is available on Arxiv<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Colorectal cancer screening through colonoscopy continues to be the dominant global standard, as it allows identifying pre-cancerous or adenomatous lesions and provides the ability to remove them during the procedure itself.

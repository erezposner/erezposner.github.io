Depth sensors are revolutionizing computer vision by providing additional 3D information for many hard problems.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"f032\">Although there are many types of depth sensor technologies (shown in Fig.1 below), they all have significant limitations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Time of Flight&nbsp;<\/strong>(TOF) systems suffer from motion artifacts and multi-path interference.<\/li><li><strong>Structured light<\/strong>&nbsp;is vulnerable to ambient illumination and multi-device interference.<\/li><li><strong>Passive stereo<\/strong>&nbsp;struggles in texture-less regions, where expensive global optimization techniques are required \u2014 especially in traditional non-learning based methods.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"03e8\">An additional depth sensor type offers a potential solution. In&nbsp;<strong>active stereo<\/strong>, an infrared stereo camera pair is used, with a pseudorandom pattern projectively texturing the scene via a patterned IR light source (Fig. 3). With a proper selection of wavelength sensing, the camera pair captures a combination of active illumination and passive light, which improves on the quality of structured light while providing a robust solution in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/heartbeat.fritz.ai\/activestereonet-the-first-deep-learning-solution-for-active-stereo-systems-f52ed2c6cd2\">The full story is available Medium<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>End-to-End Self-Supervised Learning for Active Stereo Systems Depth sensing is a classic problem with a long history of prior work.

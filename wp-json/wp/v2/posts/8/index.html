This task has many applications, such as human-machine interaction and virtual\/augmented reality, among others.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"8f35\">Estimating the spatial configuration of hand images is very challenging due to the variations in appearance, self-occlusion, and complex articulations. While many existing works considered markerless image-based understanding, most of them require depth cameras or multi-view images to handle these difficulties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"1493\">Considering RGB cameras are more widely available than depth cameras, some recent work has started looking into 3D hand analysis from monocular RGB images, mainly focusing on estimating sparse 3D hand joint locations while ignoring dense 3D hand shapes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"c184\">However, many immersive VR and AR applications often require accurate estimation of both 3D hand pose and 3D hand shape. This brings about a more challenging task: How can we jointly estimate not only the 3D hand joint locations, but also the full 3D mesh of a hand\u2019s surface from a single RGB image?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/heartbeat.fritz.ai\/hamr-3d-hand-shape-and-pose-estimation-from-a-single-rgb-image-225cba26ce2\">The full story is available Medium<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>End-to-end Hand Mesh Recovery from a Monocular RGB Image.
